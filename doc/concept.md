## Documentation:
1. Problem Description:
    - two Persons play on a MicroConroller (Pico W/ Arduino)
    - Goal of the game is to test the Reaction-Time.
    - Both Players do have a button and press if a certain Signal is shown (Light/ Noise) 
2. Tasks (used Technologies):
    - What do we need (Micro-Controller, Notebook for the WebApp, Buttons for the Micro-Controller)?
    - Used Programming-Language: C (because it´s fast), HTML/CSS/JavaScript
    - Libraries: `TODO`
    - Software-Development of the Program
    - The Micro-Controller sends the Data to the WebApp
3. Milestones:
    1. Get the needed Hardware and Libraries
    2. "Enhance our C-Coding-Knowledge"
    3. Make sure the Hardware-Components work PROPERLY
    4. Develop the C-Software on the MicroController 
    5. Develop a simple Webapp to start/stop the game/new rounds
    6. Build up the connection between Micro-Controller and Webapp
